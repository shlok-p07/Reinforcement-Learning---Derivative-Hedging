# Reinforcement Learning for Derivative Hedging

## Overview
This project explores adaptive option hedging strategies using reinforcement learning.
Traditional delta-based hedging assumes static market dynamics and fixed parameters.
Here, hedging is framed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty.

## Objective
- Minimize portfolio risk and drawdowns
- Account for transaction costs
- Compare RL-based hedging with classical delta hedging

## Methods
- Custom OpenAI Gym environment
- PPO-based reinforcement learning agent
- Simulated market dynamics with option Greeks

## Status
In active development
